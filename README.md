# How to Create a Data-Driven Culture in Construction Industry

Technology is generating drastic changes in all markets, currently the Civil Construction industry is being driven by waves of innovations focusing at calculating, sharing and storing various types of information.

Initially, there was the creation and expansion of optimization tools such as Automation Modules, Building Information Modeling (BIM), Drones and Augmented Reality, but this phase is already consolidated. In recent years, several technologies have emerged related to managing the enormous amount of information we have access to today. The focus of these technologies is to use Data Analysis and deeper concepts such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to detect strategic information, aiming to increase the efficiency of several areas of Civil Construction.

Initially, the first step in implementing a Data-Driven Culture is to understand what are the main information and knowledge that the construction company wants to acquire. Because, through the data, it is possible to obtain an infinity of answers. But what will really make a difference to the results is knowing what questions need to be asked when analyzing the data. In other words, it is essential to understand what are the problems that your company wants to solve, for example, the Engineers of a certain construction company want to develop a plan to increase the productivity of the work, in order to reduce the costs related to the re-work of the operational team . Thus, in order to solve the problem, it is necessary to collect and analyze historical data regarding the services performed, productivity metrics and information about each of the professionals.

Currently, there is a high probability that most Civil Construction companies already accumulate a significant amount of data internally, through various sources, such as: Engineering Project Software, Customer Information, Budgets and Work Schedules, Spreadsheets Measurements and Inspections Protocols, etc. In addition to the various ways in which the construction company already obtains the data, there are other ways to obtain more data (as explained in this article).

Then, before starting the process, it is crucial to establish rules for organizing the data. It means develop a series of methodologies for professionals to start collecting and storing data in an organized way, such as the location where they will be saved and the form of categorization. In summary, the reason for the very need to use Big Data will probably help guide the creation of these protocols. Currently, there are several tools that can help manage the information of a construction company in an efficient and safe way. Using software aimed specifically at data management, as well as adopting a unified management system is extremely important.

Above all, it is totally contradictory to obtain valuable information and isolate this knowledge from the rest of the organization (this is something that many construction companies do, even if unconsciously). Sharing data with all professionals involved in the work is essential for employees to realize the benefits generated by the collection, analysis and use of this data. This will help create a standard for this practice. In parallel, it is important that professionals participate in Data Analysis. The perspective of those who deal with the work on a daily basis helps to better understand certain information and transform it into practical knowledge for the construction company. In this way, involving professionals in decision-making will make them see the benefits of this strategy in practice.

Finally, as previously mentioned, it is interesting to identify the problem specifically in order to be solved, as well as to create processes and practices that facilitate the collection, storage and analysis of the data. Similarly, showing the team that Data Analysis is not just a possible alternative, but the most efficient way to make the best choices will have a highly positive impact. After all, data is the essential foundation for making decisions based on facts and not guesswork.
